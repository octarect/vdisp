## Goals

- Make CUI splendid
- Show a lot of information
- Light-weight and fast

## Required environment
I checked operations by using the following ruby versions...

- Ruby 2.2.3 (My development environment)
- It may be available on other versions(which can use curses).

## How to use
Clone this project;

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rk0der/vdisp.git
```

After that, in the directory you cloned to,

```
$ bin/vdisp
```

You may want to get a log, then please add an option, -d or --debug.

```
$ bin/vdisp -d
```

At the version of 0.1.0, the program outputs the information to display.log.
You may be able to specify a filename by future implements.
